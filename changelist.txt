# JTwitter Change list 

2.9:
 - LinkedIn and FourSquare providers made non-static (because they're not actually thread safe)
 - Added OAuthSignpostClient.getProviderResponseParams() 

2.8.9:
 - Bugfix for Twitter.countCharacters with DM microformat. 

2.8.8:
 - Altered build setup to use 1.6 compiler but target Java 1.5
 - Twitter.countCharacters will spot & discount the DM microformat "d user "

2.8.7:
 - Altered build setup to use a real copy of android.jar
 
2.8.6:
 - Added Twitter_Users.searchUsers(query, page)
 - OAuthSignpostClient constructor checks for null values.
 - Twitter.updateConfiguration returns true/false if it detects a change
 
2.8.5:
 - Added Regex, a snapshot of Twitter's URL regex. This is now used for character counting.
 - TwitterEvent for favorite now stores a Status object (not a JSON object) as the target-object.
 - Bugfix for parsing the stream event when a DM is deleted. 
 - Bugfix for change in Twitter's (still buggy) RT truncation (the change is from ... to … -- JTwitter
 will correct for this) 
 
2.8.4:
 - For easier resource management, rate limit info is now shared when using IHttpClient.copy()
 - Added IPlace.getParent()
 
2.8.3:
 - Increased the "default" Twitter.LINK_LENGTH to 23 characters, and added Twitter.MEDIA_LENGTH

2.8.2:
 - Added Twitter.account().getRateLimits() and IHttpClient.updateRateLimits() 
 - IMPORTANT: work-around for encoding issue re *
 
2.8.1: More API v1.1 changes
 - Handle v1.1 rate limits, and some 1.1 bug-fixes.
 - Retrofit Twitter.getRetweetsByMe
 - Use a more lenient charset decoder (possibly related to occasionally seeing MalformedInputException?)
 - Default value for include rts has changed.  
 - Added Status.getLang() property
 
2.8:
 - IMPORTANT: Enforced switch to API v1.1, in line with twitter.com
 
2.7.1:
 - Signpost oauth jar: Minor version upgrade (1.2.1.1 -> 1.2.1.2)
 - Improvements by Azonli (https://github.com/azonli): gzip encoding (off by default) & Scribe client update.

 - IMPORTANT: Bugfix for change in Twitter's oauth urls
 
2.6.10:
 - Use the callback url in AndroidTwitterLogin
 - Twitter.users().getFriends() can work by user-id as well as by screenname
 
2.6.9:
 - Repeated favorite (star) does not generate an error. Instead the Twitter.setFavorite() return value is null.
 - STREAM is a request type (for completeness + convenience of some use-cases).
 - TwitLonger support refactored into a separate class.
 - Catch Twitter-is-completely-hosed error pages & throw an E50X instead of a ParsingException
 
2.6.8:
 - Image upload! See Twitter.updateStatusWithMedia()
 - Started coding around the 1.0 / 1.1 switch. API version 1.0 will remain valid until March 5th, 2013.
 - Removed methods switched off by Twitter: 
	Twitter.getPublicTimeline()
	Twitter_Users.getFeatured()
 - Added Twitter.CHECK_TWEET_LENGTH to allow disabling of length-checking.
 - Twitter now send DMs as part of a UserStream. Hurrah! It only took them a year to catch up with their documentation. 
 UserStream is still deprecated, because Twitter still have bugs & the returned results are unreliable.
 - Added the disconnect event to the system events handled by AStream
 - AStream handles unknown system events gracefully.
 - Location.parse() is more robust around bad-coordinates.
 
2.6.7:
 - Added Twitter.getSinceId() and Twitter.getUntilId()
 
2.6.6:
 - Moved the support for deprecated oauth libraries, OAuthHttpClient.java and OAuthScribeClient.java, 
 into a separate source code folder, src-extra, and EXCLUDED them from jtwitter.jar.
 This fixes a Proguard issue reported by Ben Randall. 
 You can still compile and use them.
 - Added setMyPlace() to complement setMyLocation()
 - Added BoundingBox.isPoint()
 - Support for some odd WordPress return values.
 - Allow long posts to WordPress.
 - Fixes a bug in Twitter where short urls lead to bogus TweetEntity offsets.
 
2.6.5:
 - Twitter_Users.show() handles the 404 which you get if all the usernames are deleted
 users.
 - TwitterStream now guards against too many keywords, avoiding Twitter getting invalid requests.
  
2.6.4:
 - Bugfix where some entities could throw Status.getDisplayText() 
 - Minor bugfix for TwitterException.Parsing -- the message clip now clips to the first part of the json.
 - Added TwitterCounter support.
 - Added JSONArray.getList() for convenient iteration. 
 - Added IHttpClient.isRetryOnError()
 - Added workaround for a new bug in Twitter, where they sometimes send bad json (the packet gets chopped short).
 
2.6.3:
 - Bugfix for a v2.6.2 bug where updateStatus mistook "do ..." for a dm. 
 - Twitter.countCharacters() is now available as a method for url-sensitive counting.
 
2.6.2:
 - Added more Android dummy classes to allow compilation without android.jar
 - Minor early safety checks in TwitterStream
 - More documentation for the AndroidTwitterLogin class 
 - The slightly paranoid safety checking of Twitter.updateStatus() is now _off_ by default. Switch it on if desired with the Twitter.WORRIED_ABOUT_TWITTER flag.
 
2.6.1:
 - Improved AndroidTwitterLogin performance. Added onFail() method. 

2.6: Unifying geo-coding service with JGeoPlanet
 - *Breaking Change*: LatLong is replaced by Location from jgeoplanet (a sister-project by Winterwell).
 - New interfaces for geo-location: IPlace & IGeoCode
 - Some JGeoPlanet classes moved into JTwitter so we still have no dependencies beyond Signpost.
 - Minor improvements to JSONObject (error messages, map access)
 - Added AndroidTwitterLogin for easy Android Twitter access :)
 This replaces & improves on the short-lived TwitterAuthActivity of version 2.5.
 - Added Location.parse() lat/long parser
 
2.5:
 - Added getScreenNameIfKnown()
 - Added sketch code for image uploading (not ready for use yet!).
 - Added Twitter_Analytics and Twitter.analytics().getUrlCount() Thanks to ottopress.com for the info.
 - Added TwitterAuthActivity for Android users. Removed the now obsolete AndroidJTwitter example file.
 - Added dummy code for Android to the source-code in git. This handy trick avoids having to include a 
 5mb android.jar. Note: if you want to edit the TwitterAuthActivity source code in Eclipse, you may want 
 to remove the dummy folder from the build-path and replace it with an actual android.jar library.       
 
2.4:
 - Moved org.json files into winterwell.json so they can be edited to
 be a bit less annoying.
 - Added support for Klout scores! -- winterwell.jtwitter.ecosystem.Klout 
 - JSONException tweaked to be RuntimeException so it's a bit less annoying.
 - If Twitter returns html, this is reported as a server error with a TwitterException.E50X
 - Meaningful TwitterExceptions in streaming to replace e.g. IOException.
 - TwitterStream.setTrackKeywords() checks it's inputs. 
 
2.3.8:
 - Twitter have started truncating long RTs (& returning dud tweet-entities to go with them).
 Fortunately they also return the original RT, so we can correct for this. Which we now do.
 
2.3.7:
 - Fixed generic type bug on AStream.getSysEvents()
 - reconnecting is now a sys-event, reported as ["reconnect", long milliseconds-required]

2.3.6:
 - MINOR BREAKING CHANGE: Moved support for third party tools into the "ecosystem" package.
 - Added support for PeerIndex -- winterwell.jtwitter.ecosystem.PeerIndex
 - Twitter.toString() method
 - Added support for Topsy -- winterwell.jtwitter.ecosystem.Topsy
 - Added new API features Twitter.getListsAll(User) and Twitter.getRelated(ITweet)
 
2.3.5:
 - Twitter.updateStatus() no longer throws an exception if the returned status
 does not match the update. This was a workaround for an intermittent bug in Twitter -- hopefully they've patched it by now (Twitter have shown their usual awful responsiveness & comms on bugs). Removed because the vagaries of t.co
 being applied can lead to false alarms.
 - Removed use of String.isEmpty()

2.3.4:
 - Over-long tweet detection correctly handles t.co shortening of long urls.
 - Fixed bug in Twitter.updateConfiguration()
 - Added ITweet.getDisplayText() and more defensive coding for random bad data
 from Twitter
 - Added Twitter.getAPIStatus() to show how Twitter's servers are behaving.
 - Removed stray winterwell.utils references
 
2.3.3:
 - Fixed encoding issue which affected some TwitterStreams (" " is now encoded as "%20" not "+")
 - Fixed corner case issue in TweetEntity parsing. 
 - Fixed occasional (rare) null pointer in TweetEntity parsing, arising from a change in Twitter's responses.
 - Added Status.getDisplayText() which will replace TweetEntities with their
 display form.
 
2.3.2:
 - Important Bug-fixes in the Place constructor and TweetEntity.toString()
 - Improved auto-reconnect behaviour in streams. 
 - Added BadHttpClient for testing.
 - Improved json parsing to handle issues from Crockford's bad json.org code.
 - Minor breaking change: removed IHttpClient.updateRateLimits(). This is now
 handled internally by HttpClients for greater consistency. 
 - Twitter.search() tests the rpp parameter for user error.
 - Twitter.getRetweeters() does not require authentication.

2.3.1:
 - Largely cosmetic edits in streaming
 - Geometry handling in Place with a LatLong object
 
2.3: BIG BREAKING CHANGES!
This release does a large (but cosmetic) refactoring:
 - Status, User and Message now have their own files. They were getting too large
 to be comfortably held in Twitter.
 - User-related methods moved into TwitterUsers.
 However (to limit the edits required) most methods can still be called via Twitter as before. 
 - Extra support for keeping within rate-limits in SignpostHttpClient
 - Bug fix for TwitterStream using track with no keywords / follow-ids 

2.2:
 - Added ITweet.getMentions() to increase the overlap between Status and Message.
 - Added copy-constructor and IHttpClient.copy() method for safer multi-threading.
 This addresses a thread-safety issue in Signpost which can lead to an infinite loop or out-of-memory problem.
 - *breaking change:* User.isFollowingYou() and User.isFollowedByYou() return null if the information.
 is unknown. Previously they defaulted to false.
 - *Breaking change:* renamed TwitterGeo to Twitter_Geo and TwitterAccount to Twitter_Account.
 to reflect that conceptually they're an extension of the Twitter class.
 - *Breaking change:* created a TwitterAccount.Search class to describe saved searched.
 - Added E40X as a common base-class for errors that are the user's (or progammer's) fault.
 - Added entity support to ITweet and Message. 
 - Twitter.setIncludeTweetEntities() now defaults to true, so you get the t.co link info by default.
 - Streaming API: UserStream and TwitterStream provide streaming support :) 
 - Place class to model Twitter place data, plus ITweet.getPlace() and User.getPlace() 
 - Fixed date parsing bug in rate-limits (alternative format depending on source)
 - RateLimit logic bug (isRateLimited() could be overly optimistic) 
 - Fixed _another_ Twitter Search API bug!
 - Moved some of Twitter's static internal utility methods into InternalUtils.
 - Added InternalUtils.getAPIUsageStats() to allow analysis of API usage.
 - Added E406, E413, E416 exceptions (all sub-classes of E40X) for streaming-API user errors. 
 
2.1.7
 - Fixed issue with t.co shortener upsetting Twitter.updateStatus' sanity check.
 - Added Saved Search support in TwitterAccount:
 	- TwitterAccount.getSavedSearches()
 	- TwitterAccount.createSavedSearch()
 	- TwitterAccount.destroySavedSearch()
 - Added TwitterGeo to give access to Twitter geolocation search.
 - Added Twitter.setUntilId()
 
2.1.6
 - Workaround for a serious bug in the Twitter search API re location and OR
 - Removed SimpleRSSReader (no longer used since the introduction of the
 include_rts flag) 
 - Added TwitterException.AccessLevel
 - TwitterException.Timeout extends E50X to reflect that its a server issue
 - URLConnectionHttpClient.setRetryOnError() delay cut to 1/2 a second, and 
 retry now applies to all E50X cases
 - TwitterList calls init in the lazy-loading constructor. This is so an E404
 exception is thrown early if needed.
 - TwitterList lazy-loading constructor deprecated in favour of static TwitterList.get()
 method.
 
2.1.5
- Twitter.isValidLogin now uses TwitterAccount (fixes a bug with the change
 in access levels).

2.1.4
 - Added check for zero-byte chars in tweets (which occur very rarely, but can cause problems with other software).
 - Added TwitterAccount.getAccessLevel() and TwitterAccount.KAccessLevel to
 support inspection of the powers conferred by an oauth token.
 - Cleaned up test dependencies.  

2.1.3
 - Updated TwitterList methods to use the new preferred endpoints.
 - Updated Twitter.getReplies() to use the new preferred endpoint.
 - Added Twitter.getMentions() which is equivalent to getReplies()
 - Fixed bug in TwitterList.add/remove not updating the local cached list.

2.1.2
 - Patched bug in User.following/followedBy fields. 
 - Altered method name user.following() to User.followingYou() for greater clarity.
 
2.1.1
 - Added a fix for the date parsing issue with yamba.marakana.net 
 
2.1.0
 - Added Twitter.getListsContaningMe() and Twitter.getListsContaining()
 - Added TwitterList.getOwner(), and unsure why this wasn't there from the start.
 - Fixed a bug in paging, whereby retweets being missed out could cause the paging
 to stop early, and a related bug where posts during paging could lead to "page drift".
 - Changed TwitterList.toString() to include the owner
 
2.0.1
 - Added RateLimit.waitForReset()
 - Included use of SimpleDateFormat if date parsing goes wrong. This has been
 reported as a bug for the Twitter-like service run by Marakana.

 - Made Swing usage by-reflection, which makes it less of a dependency. Hence
 allows deployment on older Android devices. 
 
1.8.5
 - Added reportSpam()
 - User.getId() and Message.getId() return Long instead of Number. This is a
 backwards compatible change.
 - Fixed class cast bug in Message.equals(). Thanks to Miroslav Pokorny. 
 
1.8.4
 - Bug fixes in Twitter.updateStatus() and Status.equals()

1.8.3
 - BREAKING CHANGE: Twitter IDs have got too big for Java's long! 
 	- So Status will use BigInteger. User and Message will use Number (which will be a Long for now). 
 	- Methods which used to take long parameters, now take Number. 
 	- Use null for an unset parameter. 0 and -1 cannot be used to indicate unset parameters any more. 
 - TwitterException.SuspendedUser now thrown when appropriate for isFollower calls.
 
1.8.2
 - Url encoding now explicitly specifies UTF8, which fixes issues with exotic unicode chars on JVMs with different default settings.
